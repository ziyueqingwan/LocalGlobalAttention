# Code

There are two folders and one file under the **code** directory:

## LocalGlobalAttention.py

The **LocalGlobalAttention.py** file contains the core code of the paper. The underlying principles are explained in the paper.

## yaml

The **yaml** folder contains the YAML files required for YOLOv8 training. Files containing the `-cls` suffix are for classification, while those without it are for object detection.

## nn

The **nn** folder contains all the code required for the experiment. You can integrate this by replacing the **nn** folder in your ultralytics directory with the one in the provided code.

Alternatively, you can integrate the Local-Global Attention mechanism into your YOLOv8 model by following similar approaches used in other attention mechanism integrations.

# Experimental Comparison

The content of the **Experimental Comparison.xlsx** file includes all the experimental results and comparisons we conducted.
